# SyncSD
warp-speed SD card syncing based on volume labels

### Usage
1. Create subdirectories named like your card labels under `cards` directory
2. (optional) Edit the blacklist if so desired (useful if you want to ignore a card with a case-sensitive label)
3. Launch `sync.sh`, preferably as `# screen ./sync.sh` or `# ./sync.sh &`
4. Insert your card and wait for the notification that the copying was finished

Have fun!
